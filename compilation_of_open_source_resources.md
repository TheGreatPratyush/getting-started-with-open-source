 ## How to find issues targeted at first timers in github
 - Some issues are better suited to new contributors to an Open Source project.  To make these easier to find, they are often tagged with some of the following labels `first-timers-only`, `good first issue`, `good first task`, `beginners welcome`, `up-for-grabs`, `hacktoberfest`, `codeheat`
