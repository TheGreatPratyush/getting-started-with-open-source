1. Programming Knowledge

Know at least one programming language well (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.) so you can actually read and write code in a project.

Be comfortable with basic debugging and reading other people’s code — because most contributions involve understanding existing code first.


2. Version Control (Git & GitHub/GitLab)

You must know how to use Git, since almost all open source projects use it.

3. Non-Code Contributions Count Too

You don’t always need to write complex code. You can start by:

Fixing typos / grammar in docs.

Improving README.md or documentation.

Writing tests.
